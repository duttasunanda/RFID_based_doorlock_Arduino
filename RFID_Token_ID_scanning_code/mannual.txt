# üîê RFID Tag Scanner with Arduino UNO ‚Äî Full Manual

This guide will walk you step-by-step through building a simple but powerful RFID tag scanner using the **RC522 RFID Reader** and **Arduino UNO**. The final setup will scan any RFID token and display its **unique ID (UID)** in the **Serial Monitor**.


## üéØ Objective

To build an Arduino-based RFID scanner that:

* Detects an RFID tag/card/token when placed near the reader.
* Displays its unique ID (UID) in the Serial Monitor.

## üß∞ Components Required

| Component                | Quantity |
| ------------------------ | -------- |
| Arduino UNO              | 1        |
| RC522 RFID Reader        | 1        |
| RFID Token/Card          | 1+       |
| Jumper Wires (Male-Male) | 8        |
| Breadboard (optional)    | 1        |
| USB Cable for Arduino    | 1        |

## üß© Circuit Diagram / Wiring

Connect the **RC522 RFID Module** to the **Arduino UNO** as follows:

| RC522 Pin | Arduino UNO Pin |
| --------- | --------------- |
| **SDA**   | D10             |
| **SCK**   | D13             |
| **MOSI**  | D11             |
| **MISO**  | D12             |
| **RST**   | D9              |
| **3.3V**  | 3.3V            |
| **GND**   | GND             |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Always connect the RC522 to 3.3V, NOT 5V. The module is sensitive and can be damaged by 5V.

## üõ†Ô∏è Software Setup

### 1. Install Arduino IDE

Download and install the Arduino IDE from: [https://www.arduino.cc/en/software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

### 2. Install Required Library

* Go to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries`
* Search for **MFRC522** by GitHubCommunity
* Click **Install**

---


## üîé How It Works

* The **RFID module** emits an electromagnetic field.
* When a **tag/token** comes near it, the module reads its **UID**.
* The Arduino captures this UID and prints it to the **Serial Monitor**.

## üß™ How to Test

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Select the correct **Board** (`Arduino UNO`) and **Port**.
3. Upload the code to the board.
4. Go to `Tools > Serial Monitor` and set **baud rate to 9600**.
5. Bring an RFID tag near the scanner.
6. You‚Äôll see the UID printed in the Serial Monitor like this:

```
Place your RFID tag near the scanner...

## üé® Customization Ideas

You can modify this project to:

* Trigger a **relay** for door lock access.
* Record scanned IDs to an **SD card** or **Firebase**.
* Display UID on an **LCD screen**.
* Allow access only to **authorized IDs**.

Let me know if you want help with any of these!

## üí° Troubleshooting

| Issue                        | Solution                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Serial Monitor shows nothing | Check wiring and make sure RFID is close   |
| Upload error in Arduino IDE  | Make sure the correct COM port is selected |
| RC522 not detected           | Ensure it's connected to 3.3V, not 5V      |
| UID not printing             | Recheck wiring and library installation    |

## üèÅ Conclusion

You've just built a fully functional RFID scanner! You can now expand it into advanced projects like:

* Smart door lock system
* RFID-based attendance system
* Inventory management with tags
