🔐 RFID Based Door Lock System using Arduino
This project is a simple and secure RFID-based door lock system built with Arduino. It uses an RFID reader to scan RFID tags/cards and controls a servo motor to lock or unlock the door based on access permissions.

🧠 Key Features:
Scans RFID cards using MFRC522 RFID Reader

Authenticates access with predefined card UIDs

Controls a servo motor to open/close the lock

Unauthorized access attempts are denied with feedback (e.g., LED/Buzzer)

Easy to add/remove authorized cards via code

🛠️ Hardware Used:
Arduino Uno/Nano

MFRC522 RFID Reader Module

RFID Tags or Cards

Servo Motor (e.g., SG90)

LEDs and Buzzer (optional for feedback)

Breadboard and jumper wires

📦 Applications:
Smart home automation

Office or personal space access control

Student lab entry systems

DIY security projects
