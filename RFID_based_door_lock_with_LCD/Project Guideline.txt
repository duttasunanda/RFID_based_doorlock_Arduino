> A smart, secure, and simple access control system that detects authorized RFID cards and displays real-time messages on an LCD screen while controlling LEDs, buzzer, and a relay switch (ideal for doors or gates).

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build an **RFID-based Access Control System** using Arduino that:

* Scans RFID cards or tokens.
* Matches UID with pre-defined authorized IDs.
* Displays status on an **I2C 16x2 LCD display**.
* Gives **visual and audio feedback** via LEDs and buzzer.
* Controls a **relay switch** for gate/door unlocking.

## 📌 Pin Connection Guide

### 🔄 MFRC522 RFID to Arduino UNO

| RFID Pin | Arduino Pin |
| -------- | ----------- |
| SDA      | D10         |
| SCK      | D13         |
| MOSI     | D11         |
| MISO     | D12         |
| RST      | D9          |
| 3.3V     | 3.3V        |
| GND      | GND         |

> ⚠️ **Important**: Connect RFID to **3.3V only**, not 5V.

## 📦 Required Libraries

Install these libraries from Arduino IDE:

1. **MFRC522**
2. **LiquidCrystal\_I2C**

> Go to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries` and search for the libraries above.

## 🧾 Full Arduino Code

You can find the code here: \[Pastebin/GitHub repo link — *optional*]

👉 Or upload the code from \[previous message]\(scroll up).

## 🧪 How It Works

1. When the system starts, LCD shows:
   **"Scan your card"**

2. Place an RFID card near the MFRC522 scanner.

3. The system reads the UID and:

   * ✅ **If authorized**:

     * LCD shows “Access Granted”
     * Green LED turns ON
     * Relay activates (can unlock door)
   * ❌ **If unauthorized**:

     * LCD shows “Access Denied”
     * Red LED turns ON
     * Buzzer buzzes

4. After a few seconds, the system resets and prompts again:
   **"Scan your card"**

## 🔍 Sample Output (Serial Monitor)

```plaintext
UID Tag : 3F 6A B1 29
Authorized access
```

or

```plaintext
UID Tag : 25 D3 A8 1C
Access denied
```

## 🧠 Customization Options

* 🔑 Add multiple authorized UIDs
* 📶 Connect to Firebase for remote logging
* 🧾 Add SD card to log entry times
* 📱 Add Bluetooth/WiFi module for app notifications
* 🔐 Use keypad for dual authentication

## ⚙️ Troubleshooting

| Problem                     | Solution                                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| LCD not showing anything    | Check I2C address (use I2C Scanner sketch) |
| UID not reading             | Check RFID wiring; make sure tag is close  |
| Buzzer/LED not working      | Check pin numbers and circuit connections  |
| Upload error in Arduino IDE | Select correct COM port and board          |
